# App store
## There are two roles in using this application: administrator and client.
## They both need to be authenticated before using this app. After authentication, the application will send a confirmation message to the user's email. And only after verification, the user can use the application.
## Administrator can do rough operations on all models.
## But the client can't. The customer can purchase the product through this app.
## In this project I used frameworks such as Spring boot, Spring Data Jpa, Spring Security, Hibernate and Postgresql as database.
